## Notes
I used saga and styled components for the first time in this app, as you mentioned thos were technologies you were using in your development. I used material-ui for styling, I found it a bit easier to use than React-Toolbox. I focused on ensuring that requests for houses weren't made that already existed in the state. I also focused on ensuring that all house requests were made in parallel. Let me know if you have any questions.

## Tests

```
yarn test
```
